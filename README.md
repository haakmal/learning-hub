This repository has been prepared as a decentralised learning hub by [Dr Haider Ali Akmal](https://hakmal.com/info) for my students and anyone curious enough to want this information. This site is an appropriated version of [alex-shpack's hugo-book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). My contribution is towards the content which is bespoke for the courses that I teach/convene and any additional tweaking done under the hood to suit my requirements.

## Why does this exist?

As an educator coming from an Eastern tradition of education I've always found Western approaches towards learning restrictive for the student. While learning management systems like Moodle and Canvas are very efficient in what they do, they also disconnect students from learning freely in a democratised view of education. Case in point, the content provided by an institution is often restricted to the platform. I've always found this ironic as the content is normally from external sources. This is counter to my own learning from Pakistan which followed traditional centuries old mentor and apprentice methods incorporating collective learning environments. Though a minor attempt I'm hoping I've captured the spirit of this learning approach through the technology we have today.

While nothing here is revolutionary it is a work in progress learning platform, and ties into my own research in post-human pedagogies.

## If you are a student of mine...
