# Empathy Mapping

**Refer to your tutor for additional guidance with this task. There are two components you may be advised to do either or both.** Gather a friend of family member for this activity. You will need to observe them as they do this activity with you. They need to have used either a computer or a mobile phone for this and will be your user for the day. This is an empathy mapping exercise, as your user is undergoing the activity note down what they SAY, DO, FEEL, and THINK in the process. You may also consider what pains them in the experience and what would they like to gain from the experience. Refer to the attached reading for more information.

## Task2a: Mapping for Assessment

- Complete the empathy mapping requirement for 1 of your users from your assessment, you will need to draft a basic profile of your user first.
- Once complete, analyse the map and put yourself in your user’s shoes to empathise with them. Can you identify the missing links in their experience? How would you improve the experience for them? Visualising this as a mind map may be useful.

## Task2b: Empathising with your user

- **You should appropriate this task to suit your assessment scenario**
- Start by drafting a quick profile of your user, who are they and what makes them unique?
- Have your user open a food delivery app like Uber Eats and go through the process of ordering food. They don’t have to complete the order but can if they wish (this will give you additional insights). Take detailed notes of what your user SAYS, DOES, FEELs, and THINKS in the process making your empathy map.
- Once complete, analyse the map and put yourself in your user’s shoes to empathise with them. Can you identify the missing links in their experience? How would you make this experience of ordering food online better for them?
