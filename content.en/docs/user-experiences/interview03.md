# Interview: Rupert Parry

- Watch the video interview of Rupert Parry provided on Moodle

## Task

- Rupert considers how we might radically rethink users and the endless problems of password management. Considering all the information you’ve discovered, go back to the drawing board and identify what core principles and assumptions you’ve not reconsidered or questioned yet in your design. Return to the methods of observing users, identifying user needs and ideation to seek radical alternatives that challenge your assumptions. Questions you can ask now are:
    - How does someone decide to use your design and why?
    - How does a user discover further options or possibilities in your design and what is their fundamental motivation for doing so?
    - What freedoms might you remove from the user at this point? Alternatively, do you think you should be adding more freedom in your design?
- Document at least one radical variant for your design in a wireframe sketch. Also consider Verplank’s approach to using metaphors and again, how your radical variant alters the application of Nielsen’s heuristics.
