## Tasks

- Excluding the “Recognition rather than recall” heuristic, select 3 of Nielsen’s heuristics that suit your user research findings and assessment scenario. Briefly summarise how you understand the heuristic applies, this can be in a positive way or negative as a critique of the scenario/experience.
