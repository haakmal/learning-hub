# Documenting your work

This task asks you to consider your slide presentation. You will be condensing a large amount of work into a very short amount of presentation time. Lay out everything you have done and consider what is the most important and what can be scrapped.

##### **Task**

- Briefly note your “design outtakes”. This is a chance to “exorcise” them so that you don’t feel compelled to include every minor detail in your presentation.
- Spend at least 1 hour preparing and tidying up prototypes that you will bring into class in Week 10 to discuss. It is essential that you have something to show in Week 10 to get feedback from your lecturer and peers.
- Be prepared to discuss a critical component of your presentation and reflect on your designs.
- Share any development work of your presentation (current slides, notes, etc.)
