#   Storyboards

The goal of this activity is to explore styles of creating storyboards. Look up the many ways that people produce storyboards and make a mood board of styles for reference. Find a storyboarding style that suits your skills and interest. Remember a storyboard should NOT just be a series of screens or some text, it should depict the user and their context. Storyboarding can be done to understand the problem in a user experience or to map out how a user experience would play out. For the purposes of this task, it is assumed you have ideated on a possible design direction which will play out in your storyboard. A template is available in Week 6 for storyboarding.

## Task

- Break down the user experience you have ideated into key steps, write them out in order of operation.
- Take an A4 or A3 size paper and draw out a number of boxes where the story will be played out. You want to leave some space below each box to describe the scene. Give yourself enough space to draw the scene itself, don't make a storyboard too small!
- Draw each step identified at the start of this task as an individual scene, it may help to describe the scene first below the box then draw it out.
- Continue until you have all of your steps drawn out in individual boxes across the page.
- Have you been able to identify the following in your storyboard?
	- Does the storyboard show how the user experience will start and end?
	- Does the storyboard show how the user experience might be considered a fail?
	- Does the storyboard show how the user experience might be considered a success?
- If you answered "NO" to any of the above questions, consider adding or removing from your storyboard to address them.
