# Iterative Design

The purpose of this activity is to revisit concepts explored in the previous weeks and encourage small changes in the usability of your interface. You may need to reconsider some questions raised across tasks in workbooks.

- **Reading:** Interaction Design Foundation - Design Iteration brings powerful results, so do it again Designer!, [https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-iteration-brings-powerful-results-so-do-it-again-designer](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-iteration-brings-powerful-results-so-do-it-again-designer)

## Tasks

- Revisit some of the core questions regarding your designs so far:
	- Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions?
    - Once users have learned how to use the design to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity (i.e. are other resources required, can they complete tasks on the move)?
    - Does the design function well enough to enable users to carry out all their tasks? What cannot be completed through the design relevant to user needs or the problem?
    - Is the interface more convenient to use compared to other methods of performing the same task?
    - Is the interface modifiable for specific needs or accessibility requirements?
- Revisit your user profiles.
	- How will their use of the design differ?
	- Does the design favour one type of user over another?
	- Are there many ways to do the same thing?
	- What happens when you have a radically different kind of user?
