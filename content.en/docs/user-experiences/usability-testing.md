Usability refers to how _usable_ something is. In the context of Interaction Design usability refers to how usable an interface is. Testing the usability of a design crucial to ensure the design matches the expectations of the users and solves the problems defined by the design process. The purpose of this activity is to gain an understanding of how well your prototype works with a user.

**Note:** Be mindful of who you test with, you must always practice ethical user research and testing. **Don’t test your designs with children. Keep your testing strictly to friends and family.**
