#  Conceptual Walkthroughs

- **Reading:** Interaction Design - Preece, pg. 561-566, 16.2.2 Walkthroughs

## Task 

Following the steps in the reading, and using your storyboard from previous weeks, write down a series of questions you would want to ask about the interface, that address whether the user will have a successful experience.
