# Usability and User Experience

- **Reading:** Interaction Design - Preece, pg. 19-23, 1.7 Usability and User Experience Goals
- **Watch this video:** [Introduction to user scenarios](https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/mod/page/view.php?id=8483522), available in Week 1 on Moodle.

## Task

Consider a social media app such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc. List three or more separate sub-tasks that the app is designed to perform (e.g., make groups, buy and sell) and for each task write out a very brief scenario that describes what the user needs to do to complete the task. Make notes of anything that might go wrong (for example the user accidentally makes a group message or other common mistake).

### Given the task(s) you’ve listed address these questions

1. Is it possible for the user to work out how to complete the task by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions or do they need something explained to them?
2. Once the user has learned how to use the app to carry out their task(s), can they develop a high level of productivity (e.g., can they complete tasks on the move, speed up the process)?
3. Is the interface modifiable for specific needs or accessibility requirements? Who might be unable to complete the task (this includes people’s circumstances, such as when they are driving)?
