# Interview: Manisha Amin

- Watch the video interview of Manisha Amin provided on Moodle.

## Task

Consider Manisha’s basic challenge to the idea that most users are normal and only a small handful have disability/difficulty. List some of less obvious ways, besides physical disabilities, that you can think of that people are different. Also list some situations where a user has temporarily impaired abilities (for example a parent pushing a pram with one hand – consider an app that might need to cater for this situation). Give two examples of how technologies have enabled or excluded people from performing certain tasks? For example, voice-based interaction has supported smartphone use for visually impaired people, but in other cases the expectation that users will have a smartphone may have further limited those people’s ability to engage with services.
