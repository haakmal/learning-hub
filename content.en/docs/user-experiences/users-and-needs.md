## Tasks

- List the different categories of user of Uber Eats (i.e., not just those people ordering food – you should be able to think of at least 4 roles. Sometimes the same person might perform two roles).
- For each type of user briefly describe some of their needs. e.g., customers need a way to browse or search a range of food options.
- Give two examples where you think the needs of one user might conflict with the needs of another user. e.g., the customer might want to change their delivery time, but the driver has already set off.
