# Interview: Dunne & Raby

- Watch the video interview of Dunne & Raby provided on Moodle

## Task

- Dunne & Raby talk about the different ways in which designers can be critical about their designs through prototyping and making interactions that are trying to tell a story. How would you change your designs to address your user needs in a critical more radical manner? This form of design is speculative and often makes unique outputs that border between art and design. Feel free to be experimental with this task.
