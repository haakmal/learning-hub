# Safety in the Studio

The printmaking studio is full of hazardous materials and equipment. It is therefore necessary to exercise caution when working in the studio. You should familiarise yourself with the important signage that will be present throughout the studio environment. Some of the more common signage you can expect to see across a printmaking studio may include the following but are not limited to them as each studio operates at a different level and safety requirement.

> [!CAUTION]
> **YOU SHOULD OBSERVE ALL SAFETY REGULATIONS EXERCISED BY YOUR STUDIO**.

## Studio Safety Reference

Please follow these guidelines to ensure safety in the printmaking studio environment. This is a general rule of thumb and is expected across most if not all printmaking studios.

 > [!IMPORTANT]
>  These rules are not merely suggestions and should be considered when setting up you own space. You may need to adjust these rules accordingly to your own studio setups slightly as no two printmaking studios are the same. What is important is that the environment is both safe and comfortable to work in. This may also mean that you may not be able to execute particular methods in your studio because of safety or comfort concerns. Always keep safety first.
