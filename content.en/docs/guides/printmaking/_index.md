# Technical Guide to Printmaking

This guide is designed as an open access manual for printmaking methods many of which I teach in my courses. Please use this manual freely and return to it whenever you would like. My intention is to keep this open and available for as long as possible. As artists you may want to return to some of these methods in the future to refresh yourselves, which is the reason why I wanted to ensure this content is widely accessible outside of my classes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note.** All processes identified in this guide may need to be adapted to your own studio environments. This is a general model and these processes have worked under normal printmaking studio conditions and/or limitations. This is a work in progress and I strive to update content as I go along.

There is a rich history of printmaking that is not covered in this guide as it is intended to be a technical manual. That said, across the guide I will be giving homage to both Eastern and Western traditions of printmaking where possible.

## How to use this guide

To start follow the links to the left for specific content you would like to explore. You can also read along as you go with the buttons at the bottom of each page.

Along the way I have included additional information as pull out notes. In them you can find details on how to setup your own printmaking studios, the materials and additional resources you may want to explore, as well as smart cost effective printing methods.
