- Watch the video interview of Gillian Crampton-Smith provided on Moodle.

## Task

Gillian defines Interaction Design as a process of fusing visual things with sonic things and moving images and physical things. She is talking about how Interaction Design is more than the Graphical User Interface and includes tangible things that make up our world and the interactions in it. In your projects are you able to define where that line can be drawn between a physical and a digital object? How would you compare a dial on a website to a dial on a remote control? What are the key distinctions between these two objects and how does that translate to their interaction?
