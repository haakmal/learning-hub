# Tangible User Interfaces

- **Watch this video:** Watch Hiroshi Ishii's discussion on Tangible Interfaces provided on Moodle.
- **Watch this video:** James Pattern, _The best computer interface? Maybe... your hands?_, [https://www.ted.com/talks/james_patten_the_best_computer_interface_maybe_your_hands](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_patten_the_best_computer_interface_maybe_your_hands)
## Task

Both video share examples of tangible user interfaces or TUI's. Selecting an interface shared in the videos, draw an Input/Process/Output map of how that interface is working. In the first video linked above by Hiroshi Ishii an example is provided for what this Input/Process/Output map could look like, but you are free to work it differently.
