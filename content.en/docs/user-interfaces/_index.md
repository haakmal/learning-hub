## 1. About this book

Welcome to the UX Workbook! This workbook catalogues additional resources and valuable skills that you can learn as an Interaction Designer through workable tasks and activities focused on User Experience Design and the Interaction Design process. The tasks in this book started as individual worksheets provided to students of this course as homework activities. After feedback from students and tutors they are now available to all students as a side activity they can print and take with them to learn from in future or during their time in this course. Hopefully the hard work that has gone into making these activities proves helpful to you on your journey learning Interaction Design!

#### **Do I have to complete these tasks?**

No, you don't have to complete the tasks in this book to pass this course. These worksheets are provided as additional learning and you are recommended to pick and choose the skills you would like to learn or improve.  
_Note, your class tutor may recommend completing or assign some activities as homework._

#### **How to read this book**

Each page in this book is a task that can be attempted to learn a core skill required of Interaction Designers. There are multiple workbooks provided for different core skills: User Experience Design (UX), User Interface Design (UI), Usability Testing, and Prototyping. To attempt a task or if you have been assigned one by your tutor, navigate to the appropriate section number (e.g. 2_.1 Elements of Interaction_) using the **_table of contents_** on the right/left and read through the task. Some tasks may come with additional readings, software to download, questions to answer, and links provided. Additional resources are provided at the end in a **_Resources_** section. As you complete tasks from this workbook, remember to keep track in your process journals as any activity you do will count towards participation in this course.
