# Wireframing

The purpose of this activity is to explore wireframing and mapping better user flow. You can utilise this method while designing interfaces in Assessment 2.

## Task

- Pick an app you use every day and draw its wireframe 3 levels deep. How many different pathways are there for the user? Look at the longest paths, are any shortcuts possible?
- Draw a second wireframe that changes the original pathways to make them more efficient (try to get shorter distances from one screen to the next so users can quickly move around).
- You may need to rethink interactions such as swiping, tapping, etc. to make the wireframe more efficient. Consider how you will be showing that interaction in your wireframe.
