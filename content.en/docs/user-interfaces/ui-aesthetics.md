# UI Aesthetics

- **Reading:** Designing interfaces, Tidwell, pg. 282-294. Ranges in Visual Styles. Provided on Moodle in Week 7 resources.

## Task

Read through the chapter provided. The section on _Ranges in Visual Styles_ should be your focus but the whole chapter is a good read for this task. Observe the different styles identified in the chapter. Write a short 150–200-word explanation of what UI aesthetics you plan to explore for your design solutions and why? Give visual examples, they can come from your own designs.

You are free to challenge the aesthetics suggested in the reading and propose your own. Examples and explanation are required.
