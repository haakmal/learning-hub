# Paper Prototyping

This is a lengthy task. Take your time exploring techniques for paper prototyping.
## Reading

- Interaction Design - Preece, pg. 422-428 12.2, Prototyping (case study in resources)
- Read through Case Study 1 in the Resources of this workbook. Consider the dimensions of your prototyping. If you were using paper to prototype the design of a parking meter’s touch-screen interface, which dimensions would you be addressing with respect to the parking meter as a whole? What would the paper prototype fail to properly test?

## **Task**

For the rest of this task you will be using your own gathered user research from Assessment 1.

- Gather the materials needed for making a paper prototype (pens, paper, card, etc), you will be preparing prototypes for testing.
- Select a design concept from your ideation. Focusing on a specific task that fits your user’s goals.
- Prepare 2-3 screens as a paper prototype. Be sure to connect it to the scenario and storyboards you’ve been developing for your design.
- Experiment with how best to use pen-and-paper to arrange the concepts of a screen-based UI.
- Briefly test your paper prototype with a user (a friend or family member). At this stage focus on seeing how you can improve your paper prototype making, rather than the design of the app itself. Look at where the prototype failed to properly represent your design and/or interactions.
- **Comment on methods you develop and upload photos of your paper prototypes,** both micro details (specific screens) and macro details (flows through screens).
- Take photographs of your designs, or a video of yourself interacting with the interface.
