# Physical Prototyping

Irrespective of how you approach an interaction design project, no amount of digital prototyping can replace a physical prototype. Often a project will need to have an understanding of physical experiences mapped before digital or software-based experiences can be designed. For example, consider the design of a smart phone. While the GUI is often considered the main feature you interact with and design for, it is a secondary feature that only becomes apparent once the physical design of the smartphone has been finalised. It’s shape, form, tactility, all become important aspects of the design phase for a smartphone.

Even when we design for a software-based output such as a mobile app, you will very often start with a physical prototype made in paper or simpler material before spending time in software. This is because physical prototype especially when done using paper is cheap, reliable, and quick to execute/manipulate. As a habit make physical prototyping the first step when you enter a design process. Tasks in this section cover the different ways physical prototypes can be explored as an interaction designer.
