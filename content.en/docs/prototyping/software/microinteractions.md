# Animations & Micro Interactions

> [!WARNING]
> **Note.** LinkedIn Learning resources are in the process of being replaced.

In this lesson we go through micro-interactions in IxD and how they are used within UI/UX. Software such as Adobe XD and Figma are not true animation software but often animations are required to simulate micro-interactions such as scrolling, swiping, tapping, etc. Also in this category are micro interactions and often hint towards specific information intended to accentuate the user experience.

- **Adobe XD**

## Task

Follow along with the tutorial to create an animated prototype. Experiment with different kinds of animations possible in a UI. You can repurpose screens you designed from a previous worksheet for this task. Do one of each of the following in your UI:

- A scroll/swipe animation
- A button animation
- A progress animation
- Identify an error to the user using a micro interaction

**Submission:** All the above can be done in a single screen or multiple. Submit a URL to your interactive prototype using the share feature in Adobe XD or Figma. Upload to forums if required.
