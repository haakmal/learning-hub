# Software Prototyping

When designing an interaction that will primarily be experienced as a GUI then bespoke prototyping software such as Figma or Sketch is used. This is normally done after a series of physical paper-based prototyping phases to iron out details before spending time on a digital prototype made in software. That said, in some cases where the interface is not as complicated, moving straight into a software might often be the better option to save on time.

## Accessing Prototyping Software

_Note, which software to use for prototyping will depend on industry expectations and your design workflow. Always keep up with current trends in design and remain updated on technology._

Access to the complete Adobe CC suite is provided as part of your enrolment into this course. For this course prototyping software such as Adobe XD or Figma can be used where necessary for digital prototyping purposes. Figma is more actively used in industry and is a more comprehensive tool for the purposes of UI/UX digital prototyping. Where Adobe XD is still used in spaces, its development is limited making many practitioners in industry preferring Figma as their tool of choice instead.

**Note,** UNSW IT may not be able to provide support for Figma as this software is not licensed to the University.
**Note,** Additional tutorial files designed for this course are provided in the Software & Learning Section

## Installing Figma

Figma can be used completely in the browser but a desktop version is also available. You may opt to use Figma and pay for it yourself, or as a student you may be eligible to a free educational plan. Details on the Education Plan are provided here: [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041061214-Verify-education-status](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041061214-Verify-education-status)

- Download Figma for your operative system: [https://www.figma.com/downloads/](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)
- You will need to create a Figma account
- Figma provides an education account for students, you are required to verify your student status with them and may be required to repeat this verification annually. It is recommended to use this over a standard account as you get the full Figma experience for free. Use your university email while setting up your account to make the process smoother and have a supporting document with you (e.g. transcripts, proof of enrolment, or student ID card).
- Follow this link to setup a student account with Figma: [https://www.figma.com/education/higher-education/](https://www.figma.com/education/higher-education/)
- Start installer and follow on screen prompts to install Figma
- You may want to additionally install Figma’s companion mobile app for testing your designs at a later stage
