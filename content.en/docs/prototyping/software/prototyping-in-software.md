# Prototyping in Software

> [!WARNING]
> **Note.** LinkedIn Learning resources are in the process of being replaced.

In this lesson we go through the process of taking all your UI design work and linking them up as a basic click-through prototype that can be used for usability testing. You’ll learn how to use the inbuilt prototyping tools and how to share a prototype.

## Task

Follow along with the videos above to learn how to prototype a design. For this task you can either:

- Reuse a previous prototype/design you have been working on (you should have at least 3 screens for this task), or
- Create a new one by replicating 3 screens from the Coles, Woolworths, Spotify, or Ikea apps.

Recreate as many of the interactions in the interface as you can, these include tap/click events such as hover, click, drag, scrolling, gestures, and internal interactions like opening a drop-down menu or a pull-out menu.

**Submission:** You will need to use the in-built sharing function in your prototyping software to share a URL of your prototype for testing. Provide this link as submission for this task. Upload to forums if required.
