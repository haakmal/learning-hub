# Welcome to the Learning Hub

This repository has been prepared as a decentralised learning hub by [Dr Haider Ali Akmal](https://hakmal.com/info) for students and anyone curious enough to want this information. Some of this information is coming from textbooks and has been credited where due. The theme used is an appropriated version of [alex-shpack's hugo-book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). My contribution is towards the content which is bespoke for the courses that I teach/convene and any additional tweaking done under the hood to suit my requirements.

## Why does this exist?

### The short answer...

These courses used to have worksheets that felt cumbersome. I also did not like how students would be disconnected from this knowledge once the course was done. This way they can continue their learning and share.

### The long boring answer...

As an educator coming from an Eastern tradition of education I've always found Western approaches towards learning restrictive for the student. While learning management systems like Moodle and Canvas are very efficient in what they do, they also disconnect students from learning freely in a democratised view of education. Case in point, the content provided by an institution is often restricted to the platform. I've always found this ironic as the content is normally from external sources. This is counter to my own learning from Pakistan which followed traditional centuries old mentor-apprentice methods incorporating collective and passive learning approaches. Though a minor attempt I'm hoping I've captured the spirit of this ideology through this online knowledge repository.

While nothing here is revolutionary it is a work in progress learning platform, and ties into my own research in post-human pedagogies. If you are interested in that please reach out, I'd love to chat more: https://hakmal.com/contact-form
